/* Security Features
We'll implement encrypted communication with TLS using OpenSSL.

You can use ZeroMQ's TLS support (via zmq::curve for encryption). This requires configuring SSL certificates and setting up secure connections
*/
  /*
   Scalability
For horizontal scaling, consider using multiple server instances behind a load balancer to distribute client requests. This could involve using a Redis-based queue to handle requests across multiple backend servers.

Final Structure
After implementing the suggested improvements, the structure of your application might look like this:

Main program: Starts the ZeroMQ server, order book, thread pool, and persistent storage.
OrderBook: Handles order matching and persistence.
ZeroMQServer: Listens for client requests and publishes order book updates.
ThreadPool: Handles order matching concurrently.
Logging: Tracks order processing and system status.
