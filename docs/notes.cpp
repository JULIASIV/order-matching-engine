/*
Server-Side:

Implement the order book with an efficient matching algorithm.
Integrate ZeroMQ for better communication.
Use a thread pool to handle concurrent order processing.
Persist the order book data to disk.
Client-Side:

Allow users to place buy and sell orders.
Display the current order book.
Implement a better user interface for client interaction.
*/

/*
Key Changes:
Order Book Handling: The server now maintains an order book and can place buy and sell orders.
Order Matching: A separate thread is used to match orders between buyers and sellers.
ZeroMQ: Both the client and server communicate via ZeroMQ. The client can place orders, request the order book, and exit the application.
Threading: The order matching logic runs on its own thread in the server for continuous order matching.
Next Steps:
Testing: Test the program with multiple clients and orders.
Persistence: Add file-based or database persistence to save order book states across restarts.
Security: Implement security mechanisms for ZeroMQ connections (like CURVE encryption).
Optimization: Further optimize order matching and thread management as needed.
